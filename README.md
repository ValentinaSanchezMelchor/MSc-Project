# MSc-Project
This repository will be used to record the progress of my MSc Project, from toy and exploratory coding to the final project.

The project will consist on using GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) to analyse interactions between Twitter users and predict if they belong to a specific political ideology (right wing / left wing). It it to be discovered what are the capabilities and advantages of using GNNs for this clasification task.
